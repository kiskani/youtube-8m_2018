# youtube-8m_2018

This is my implementation and code for the second Youtube video understanding challenge https://www.kaggle.com/c/youtube8m-2018

This solution is based on the original youtube starter code at https://github.com/google/youtube-8m and the 5th rank solution of last year at https://github.com/mpekalski/Y8M. However, I have modified both of these codes to get an answer.
