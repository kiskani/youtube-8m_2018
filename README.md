# youtube-8m_2018

This is my implementation and code for the second Youtube video understanding challenge https://www.kaggle.com/c/youtube8m-2018

This solution is based on the original youtube starter code at https://github.com/google/youtube-8m and some of the high ranking solutions of last year from https://www.kaggle.com/c/youtube8m/leaderboard. For video level models, I used models similar to the ones in https://github.com/wangheda/youtube-8m and for the frame level models, I used the ones in https://github.com/mpekalski/Y8M. However, I have modified all of these codes to get my final result.
